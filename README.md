My name is NNNI. I'm an electronics hobbyist (and self-proclaimed electrical engineer) currently based in Hannover, Germany. My interests include analog circuit design and precision circuits and techniques. You can contact me on Discord, where I'm active almost all the time: @nnnilabs, or view some of my [Marco Reps emulations](https://www.youtube.com/@NNNILabs).
